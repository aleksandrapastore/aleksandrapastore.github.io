            <h2>Software Engineer II - Associate (July 2024 - Present)</h2>
            <p>
                After completing the graduate programme in finance, I decided to shift my focus to a more technical field and became a Software Engineer Associate at the J.P. Morgan Glasgow Technology Centre. 
                This role presented a steep learning curve, blending technical challenges with soft skills like learning the software development lifecycle, working in an agile model, and maintaining excellent version control. 
                However, the most significant growth for me came on the technical side. 
                My knowledge of Python accelerated rapidly as I worked with extensive codebases understanding, modifying, and testing large codebases.
                I learned to write unit and end-to-end tests, manage virtual environments through pypi's poetry package, and gained a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles. 
                The team was in the process of migrating data processing to Databricks, a cloud-based platform focused on managing data and AI solutions, so I quickly became accustomed to creating workflows and running serverless jobs on Databricks.
                Additionally, I worked with multiple remote repositories and implemented version control using GIT.

            <h2>Corporate Analyst (July 2022 - July 2024)</h2>
            <p>
                During the Corporate Analyst Development Programme (CADP), I completed three eight-month rotations across different financial teams: the Target Operating Model team, Investment Middle Office Services (IMOS), and the client facing Operations Service Delivery team (OSD). 
                The nature of the work was different in each team but all of them offered valuable experience working with large financial databases and writing SQL queries to retrieve and input the required information.
                Moreover, I gained experience with data analysis and visualisation tools, such as Alteryx and Tableau, quickly becoming the primary point of reference for my team members.
                Strong soft skills were also required by the programme to effectively communicate with clients, resolve conflicts, and ensure they have the same vision of the path forward.

            <h2>Corporate Analyst - Summer Internship (June-August 2021)</h2>
            <p>
                While at university, I applied my mathematical skills to finance through a summer internship at J.P. Morgan in the Data Solutions process improvement team. 
                My role involved retraining an AI-based software with machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and enhance client communication efficiency. 
                This experience provided a valuable applied perspective, allowing me to learn more about the software development lifecycle and explore the potential of machine learning and algorithm testing. 
                My internship was successful, leading to an offer for a full-time position at J.P. Morgan in their Corporate Analyst Development Programme after graduation.
