                    <a href="Final Project Aleksandra Pastore.pdf" class="one"><u>"Exploration of the Drosophila circadian rhythm mathematical model"</u></a>
                </p>    
                <p><b>Abstract:</b>
                    <br>The biological rhythm with a period of 24 hours, called circadian, plays a crucial role in the
                        process of adaptation to the external environment by regulating the timing of certain physiological
                        processes, such as hormone release and body temperature regulation. The functioning of the
                        rhythm has been extensively studied biologically, however, biological experiments can have limitations
                        in their execution. To overcome such limitations, researchers can use mathematical models
                        to simulate and study the circadian rhythm. The present paper examines the methods employed
                        in research for building mathematical models of circadian oscillations of the fruit fly Drosophila.
                        The first part of the paper explains the simplified structure of the circadian system and the main
                        biological processes involved in its functioning. Then differences between the deterministic and
                        stochastic models of the negative feedback loop of the Drosophila circadian oscillations are presented
                        in order to build an understanding of the circumstances where each of these models can
                        be most useful. Graphical results from implementation of these models in MATLAB simulations
                        are analysed and compared to biological findings. The effect of light on the Drosophila circadian
                        system is then incorporated into the models and explored by variation of the light parameter.
                        Specifically, case studies of jet lag and night shift work are simulated with a clear statement
                        of corresponding assumptions and limitations, confirming the negative effect of such disruptions
                        mathematically. Stochastic simulations of oscillations perturbed by light are also presented along
                        with a description of more advanced modelling methods, such as Extrande, minimising errors in
                        such simulations. The methods used in the present study can lay a foundation for future research
                        on the mammalian circadian rhythm. Results from the paper can be used for a better understanding
                        of the internal clock's functioning, as well as an insight into the employment of different
                        mathematical models for research on the topic.

                <h2> Scholarship for the summer semester at John Cabot University in Rome </h2>
                <p>
                    After winning the final country level of the School Olympiad in Italian, I was awarded a scholarship to attend summer semester courses at the John Cabot University in Rome. 
                    I decided to take a course in Global Media to achieve a deeper understanding of means of communication and information flows, as well as a course in photography. 
                    For the latter, we had the opportunity to go to a museum about ancient Rome to take pictures for our portfolio. 
                    It was a fantastic experience to explore such an artistic venue, finding interesting or unusual angles for our shots. 
                    The subsequent process of editing the pictures and combining them into a portfolio also required creativity and thus started interesting discussions among students.
