                <h2> Travelling </h2>
                <p>
                    Travelling has always been one of my hobbies, with explorations of my parents' two countries starting when I was just 9 months old. Now I mainly travel with family, friends, or solo. I like exploring new cultures and different ways of life. Travelling also provides a good way to take a break from the routine and get inspired.

                            <h3>Switzerland - Geneva and Zurich</h3>
                            <p>The trip to Switzerland in May 2024 was inspired by my studies of physics at the University of St Andrews. During that time I took a course in Quantum physics where the professor unveiled the world of quantum particles to us. In particular, I remember the students being fascinated by the Higgs boson, which was discovered in 2012 using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva. During my trip, I visited the CERN Science Gateway museum with a friend from university. We learned many new facts about the quantum world through the interactive exhibition there. After that, we also decided to visit the city with its famous Jet d'eau, before going to Zurich to explore the German-speaking part of Switzerland and visit the Lindt Chocolate Factory.</p>

                            <h3>Belgium - Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels</h3>
                            <p>In August 2024 I went on a trip to Belgium to explore its Art Nouveau architecture. My first stop was Antwerp, where I saw the Centraal Railway station with its eclectic style, visited the Modern Art Museum and tasted the local Frites. The second stop, Bruges, was inspired by the famous movie 'In Bruges' written by Martin McDonagh but the city offered much more than that, being a UNESCO world heritage site. This city is perfect for long walks on the cobbled streets along the canals. As the last stop, I also made sure to visit the capital, Brussels, where I saw the Royal Palace, St. Michel and St. Gudula Cathedral - coronation venue, and visited the majestic Grote Markt. As a special tour, I also went to the European Parliament to learn more about the processes behind EU democracy.</p>

                            <p>Sori is a picturesque town located in the Italian region of Liguria. We enjoyed its quiet rocky beaches and clean sea. We also made sure to explore area by taking day trips to nearby towns, such as the famous Cinque Terre, Camogli, Genoa, Nervi, and Portofino. Those towns all share a traditional northern Italian atmosphere, which inspired my mom to create some landscape paintings.</p>

                            <p>My trip to Moscow this year was different from other years as the temperatures were quite high, with only a few snowy days. This was very good for long walks along my favourite streets. I spent time with family and friends, went ice skating on the Red Square, visited the zoo, explored theatres and museums. Moscow is such a big and fulfilling city that you can always find something interesting to see or do. </p>

                        <h3>The Highlands</h3>
                        <p>In March 2024 I decided to explore the Scottish Highlands by car with my father. The first stop was Inverness, which is regarded the capital of the Highlands. There we walked along the River Ness, visited the famous Scotland's largest secondhand bookshop Leakey's, and listened to some traditional fiddle music. The trip could not have been complete without a visit to the iconic Loch Ness and the Urquhart Castle. Both places became symbols of Scotland, so it was very interesting to learn their history during a guided tour. Finally, we also visited Fort William and its West Highland Museum where we explored the military achievements of the Highlanders.</p>

                        <h3>The Lake District</h3>
                        <p>The Lake District is the largest National Park in England as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. I went there with a friend to walk on hiking trails around lakes and explore the well-preserved nature of the place. The walk along lake Windermere - the largest natural lake in England, was a great physical activity that also offered picturesque views. We then finished the trip in the market town of Ambleside, where we enjoyed local produce and visited the Armitt museum that hosts a collection of ancient artifacts found in the region of Cumbria. The long walk ended with a lively discussion of the experience and plans to complete this trip with a visit to the Peak District National Park sometime soon! </p>
