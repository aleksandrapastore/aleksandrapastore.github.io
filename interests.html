            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <h2>Playing the Violin</h2>    
            <p>
                I decided to start playing the violin at the age of 6, starting my musical education by learning the correct technique and playing simple compositions.
                As I progressed through the grades, I was able to play more advanced pieces that could be performed at concerts and competitions.
                During university years, I joined the St Andrews Symphony Orchestra. It was a fun experience to play and perform with fellow students. Our concerts featured Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and Symphony No. 6, as well as Rimsky-Korsakov's famous Scheherazade.
                In Edinburgh, I joined the <a href="https://www.newedinburghorchestra.org.uk/" class="one"><u>New Edinburgh Orchestra </u></a>, which is a community group of about 80 members. I enjoy playing the violin there as it motivates me to keep practicing and the concerts are always a big success!
            </p>    
            <h2>Reformer Pilates</h2>
            <p>
                Physical activity plays a major role in my life, as it boosts energy levels before or after a long day of work, and improves fitness.
                One of my favourite ways of exercising is Pilates, which is a low-impact activity that improves flexibility, strength, posture and coordination. 
                However, I most enjoy doing it to improve mindfulness and bring the focus of my attention to the present moment. 
                I usually do mat pilates at home about three times a week and go to reformer classes to use the special machines once a week.
            </p>
            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
                I became interested in Nutrition when I was exploring the topic of healthy lifestyle, experimenting with my diet to track the impact on my energy levels.
                In 2024 I completed Master level degree modules in Clinical Nutrition from the Rowett Institute, which was a great way to gain scientific knowledge of micro and macronutrients, as well as to explore societal issues of obesity and undernutrition.
                At present, my interest concerns data science applications in nutrition to analyse health metrics, form science-based recommendations, and build predictive models.
            </p>
            <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As I work in the fast-changing field of technology and software engineering, I always try to advance my knowledge outside of my job by developing personal projects that I then upload on my <a href="https://github.com/aleksandrapastore" class="one"><u>GitHub</u></a>.
                I enjoy working on coding projects by myself or with a mentor, exploring new exciting topics!
                My first project was focused on the basics of HTML by creating these portfolio pages and styling them with CSS.
            </p>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>
                I make an effort to read every day, despite my busy schedule. Some of my favourite books include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
                    <li>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</li>
                    <li>The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown</li>
                    <li>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</li>
                    <li>The Inspector Rebus detective novels series by Ian Rankin</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>
                Running is a great form of cardio exercise that can be included in an office worker's daily routine. 
                A coworker inspired me to start running with her at lunchtime, and I was surprised by the increased productivity and motivation that we got after our runs. 
                In October 2024, I completed my first 10k distance in under an hour at the AJ Bell Great Scottish run in Glasgow, sponsored by J.P. Morgan.
                My next challenge is the Edinburgh Marathon festival in May 2025 where I am aiming for a 10k in 57 minutes. 
            </p>
            <h2>Ice Skating</h2>
            <p>
                Wonderful Russian winters offer an amazing atmosphere for ice skating with friends.
                Some of my favourite places to ice skate in Moscow include the GUM skating rink on the Red Square, the Gorky Park rink, Sokolniki, and VDNKH with a surface area of over 20,000 square meters.
                In Edinburgh, I usually go to the Ice Skating arena at Murrayfield, where I practice new figure skating elements with my friend.
